# That Weird Site

Each line of code has a story behind it. Some of them are born from the muscle memory built after hours of youtube videos and practice, while some (almsot all) belong to the famous lineage of stackoverflow codes. This one is neither of the two. Even I have no idea why I started this. And the strange part is, why in the world I'm writing this at 3 in the morning, in times when I'm supposed to be studying for my end semester exam.

Anyways, this project started when I was bored on one Monday evening and not in mood to study for the exam or work on my main side project, (yes, normalize prioritisation among side projects). I was bored to do anything, so I did what's one of my favorite pass times, playing with CSS. Created a new file, with only html and css, picked a random pallet from colorhunt and two random, nice looking fonts which I had never used to before from google fonts. And that's how it started. The first piece was that glow effect and change of words while hovering on it. Then from there VSCode was a playground and I was a 5-year-old. This is not any project or something. This is just what happened when I played with stuff I know and ended up making stuff I hadn't known. Here are some tips for those accessing this website.


## For Users
- At time of wrting this, this website is not very 'mobile-friendly' or 'touch-device-friendly' because of a lot of cursor stuff going on. However, I'll be working on it :p

- There are few hidden stuffs spread randomly all across the screen... move your cursor, have fun with them. More of such stuffs will be added in future.

- This project is all open to suggestions and spin-off. Since, it's a brainchild of a bored brain, I think it won't mind having siblings. 

## For Fellow Developers

- I made this entire project, with no design refernce or any refernce for that matters, in a single sitting of 4 hours. 

- I spent most of the time playing around with codes rather than actually building it.

- But no code is perfect, and mine is definitely not... i know. So please, look into the repo, go through the code and provide me your valuable feedback and suggestions.
